# FMSE
This Repository is intended to exercise for the lecture **Formel Methods in Software Engineering** at the Leibniz University Hanover.

## Mini Projects
  * LTS - Labeled Transition System
  * CTL - Computational Tree Logic

## Running Project
  * This is a Java Project made by [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org/), so it would be easier if you have Eclipse IDE running or you can also import the project to other IDE if possible.
  * This project requires [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php) installed on your machine.
